# Ahmed Albarqi  
<span id="typed-role" class="typed-role"></span>

Ahmed Albarqi is a policy and computational social science researcher studying how data, predictive analytics, and institutional design shape social outcomes. His work focuses on housing affordability, homelessness, forced labor, and demographic change, with an emphasis on causal inference, time-series analysis, and applied machine learning to evaluate public policy interventions. His current research examines the dynamic relationship between housing markets and shelter populations in New York City, the impact of refugee inflows on housing prices across European countries, and predictive modeling of fertility rate trends. His applied work bridges rigorous quantitative analysis with real-world policy design across social welfare, labor markets, and urban policy.

Ahmed is currently pursuing a Master of Public Policy and Administration at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, specializing in Data Science for Policy with minors in Program Evaluation and Social Policy. He is a Graduate Researcher at the International Labour Organization (ILO), where he applies rigorous quantitative analysis of panel administrative and survey data to inform policy-relevant research on the social and economic determinants of forced labor. Prior to Columbia, he worked at Deloitte in public-sector consulting, contributing to regulatory reforms, data-driven investment decisions, and digital transformation initiatives. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with minors in Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence.
