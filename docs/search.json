    "text": "Homelessness is one of New York City’s most persistent and structurally complex policy challenges. It has remained a central issue for successive governors, mayors, and political leaders, reflecting deep-rooted pressures in the city’s housing market and social safety net. Public discourse and empirical research have consistently linked homelessness to housing affordability, particularly rising rents, with higher rental costs often associated with increases in the number of individuals relying on shelter systems. Understanding the dynamic relationship between rental prices and shelter population is therefore critical for policymakers seeking to design effective housing and homelessness interventions.\nThis report conducts a detailed time-series analysis using a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) framework to examine the relationship between the monthly average shelter population and the median asking rent in New York City over the period from March 2021 to October 2025. The analysis explores how these two variables co-evolve over time and interact through their respective lag structures. In addition, the estimated model is used to generate forecasts for both variables over a 12-month horizon, from November 2025 to October 2026, providing insight into potential future trends in housing affordability and shelter demand.\n\n\nThis report examines the dynamic relationship between housing affordability and homelessness in New York City using a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) framework. The analysis is guided by the following research questions:\n\nWhat is the dynamic relationship between median asking rents and the shelter population in New York City?\nHow do changes in rental prices and shelter population co-evolve over time, and how does each variable respond to its own past values and those of the other variable?\nDo changes in median asking rents Granger-cause changes in the shelter population, and vice versa?\nTo what extent do past movements in rents help predict future shelter demand, and is there evidence of feedback effects from shelter population changes to rental prices?\nWhat is the timing and magnitude of the shelter population’s response to rental price shocks?\nHow quickly do shocks to housing affordability transmit to the shelter system, and are these effects short-lived or persistent?"

    "text": "Stationarity Test\nStationarity is a prerequisite for valid VAR estimation and forecasting. Time series that exhibit trends or unit roots can lead to spurious regression results if modeled in levels.\nVisual inspection of the level series Figure 1 indicates that both the monthly average shelter population and the median asking rent display trending behavior hence the series are non-stationarity. Consistent with this observation, Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test results reported in Table 1 fail to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root for both series.\n\n\n\n\n\nShelter Population\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Shelter Population and Median Rent Over Time\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: ADF Test Results for Shelter Population and Median Rent\n\n\nVariable\nLag\nADF\nP_value\n\n\n\n\nShelter Population\n0\n-0.34\n0.986\n\n\nShelter Population\n1\n-1.20\n0.899\n\n\nShelter Population\n2\n-1.03\n0.925\n\n\nShelter Population\n3\n-1.63\n0.721\n\n\nMedian Rent\n0\n-1.54\n0.755\n\n\nMedian Rent\n1\n-2.42\n0.397\n\n\nMedian Rent\n2\n-2.83\n0.238\n\n\nMedian Rent\n3\n-2.49\n0.371\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying logarithmic transformations does not resolve the non-stationarity.

Figure 2 demonstrates stable behavior for both differenced series, and the ADF test results in Table 3 reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity at conventional significance levels. Consequently, both variables are treated as integrated of order one, I(1), and the VAR model is estimated using first differences of the log-transformed series.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth Rate of Shelter Population\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Growth Rates of Shelter Population and Median Rent\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: ADF Test Results for Differenced Log Variables\n\n\nVariable\nLag\nADF\nP_value\n\n\n\n\nDiff Log Shelter\n0\n-2.96\n0.010\n\n\nDiff Log Shelter\n1\n-2.83\n0.010\n\n\nDiff Log Shelter\n2\n-1.93\n0.054\n\n\nDiff Log Shelter\n3\n-2.18\n0.031\n\n\nDiff Log Rent\n0\n-3.91\n0.010\n\n\nDiff Log Rent\n1\n-2.82\n0.010\n\n\nDiff Log Rent\n2\n-2.87\n0.010\n\n\nDiff Log Rent\n3\n-3.35\n0.010"

If such a relationship is present, a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) would be more appropriate than a VAR in differences.\nJohansen’s cointegration test was conducted using the log-level series. As reported in Table 4, the test statistic for the null hypothesis of no cointegration (r = 0) is 8.26, which is below the 5 percent critical value of 15.67. Therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, indicating no evidence of a stable long-run relationship between shelter population and median rent.\nGiven the absence of cointegration, a VAR model in first differences is appropriate, and a VECM specification is not warranted.\n\n\n\nTable 4: Johansen Cointegration Test Results (Maximum Eigenvalue Statistic)\n\n\nHypothesis\nTest_Statistic\nCrit_10pct\nCrit_5pct\nCrit_1pct\n\n\n\n\nr ≤ 1\n3.22\n7.52\n9.24\n12.97\n\n\nr = 0\n8.26\n13.75\n15.67\n20.20"

    "text": "In recent decades, global conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises have contributed to a sharp rise in refugee movements worldwide. Prolonged wars in Syria, Afghanistan, and Ukraine; persecution in countries such as Myanmar and Eritrea; and sustained violence and displacement in other regions have forced millions of individuals to seek safety beyond their national borders. The European Union (EU) provides an important institutional context for understanding forced migration, as EU member states recognize asylum as a fundamental right under the 1951 Geneva Convention (European Commission, Migration & Home Affairs, 2021). To coordinate responsibility-sharing and standardize asylum procedures, EU countries established the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) in 1999.\nA key turning point occurred in 2015, when Europe experienced an unprecedented surge in refugee arrivals and asylum applications. This episode placed substantial pressure on national asylum systems and prompted renewed debate about migration governance and burden sharing, motivating policy reforms and renewed coordination efforts at the EU level.\nThe increase in refugee arrivals has also generated debate about downstream economic and social impacts. One central concern is housing: refugee inflows may increase housing demand and affect local prices, though effects may vary across countries depending on settlement patterns, market tightness, and policy responses. This report examines the relationship between refugee intake and house price dynamics across European countries, leveraging cross-country differences in refugee inflows and integration frameworks.\nAccordingly, the main research question is:\n\nHow does the variation in refugee intake amongst European countries impact house prices?"

These episodes represent major deviations from prior trends and suggest the presence of external shocks to refugee inflows.\n-2014–2016 The increase aligns with intensified forced displacement driven by conflict and humanitarian crises, alongside policy responses that expanded intake capacity in some EU states.\n-2021–2023 The later rise may reflect renewed geopolitical instability and post-pandemic mobility dynamics (e.g., processing backlogs and delayed movement), though the precise mechanisms require further investigation.\nAfter identifying the periods of interest, the analysis now turns to the key independent variable: refugee inflows per 1,000 residents. To provide an initial characterization of this variable, we begin with descriptive summary statistics covering the period 2010–2021, which are presented below.\nTable 1 the summary statistics reveal a clear upward trend in the refugee influx across European countries from 2010 to 2023. The mean number of refugees per 1000 residents has steadily increased from 3.47 in 2010 to 20.60 in 2023, with significant fluctuations in standard deviation (SD), reflecting varying levels of influx across countries. The years 2022 and 2023 show a sharp rise in the median values, reaching 17.14 and 21.18, respectively, accompanied by higher Q1, median, and Q3 values, indicating a broader shift towards higher refugee arrivals. Notably, the maximum values for these years (49.41 in 2022 and 52.57 in 2023) suggest a few countries experienced exceptional levels of refugee influx.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary Statistics for Refugees per 1000 Residents by Year\n\n\nYear\nCount\nMean\nSD\nMin\nQ1\nMedian\nQ3\nMax\n\n\n\n\n2010\n28\n3.47\n4.51\n0.03\n0.23\n0.98\n5.90\n17.91\n\n\n2011\n28\n3.51\n4.78\n0.03\n0.22\n1.08\n5.24\n20.17\n\n\n2012\n28\n3.52\n5.01\n0.04\n0.22\n0.91\n5.02\n21.42\n\n\n2013\n28\n3.52\n5.57\n0.05\n0.20\n1.35\n4.08\n25.35\n\n\n2014\n28\n3.69\n4.89\n0.10\n0.27\n2.26\n4.81\n20.52\n\n\n2015\n28\n5.46\n7.47\n0.13\n0.33\n3.28\n6.79\n33.32\n\n\n2016\n28\n5.76\n7.65\n0.15\n0.39\n3.08\n7.11\n31.56\n\n\n2017\n28\n5.82\n7.48\n0.16\n0.41\n2.83\n6.53\n29.09\n\n\n2018\n28\n6.05\n7.60\n0.18\n0.40\n2.93\n6.79\n28.12\n\n\n2019\n28\n6.61\n8.21\n0.18\n0.44\n3.77\n7.13\n27.41\n\n\n2020\n28\n6.81\n8.34\n0.17\n0.39\n3.85\n8.51\n26.48\n\n\n2021\n28\n7.20\n8.80\n0.20\n0.48\n4.60\n8.78\n31.59\n\n\n2022\n28\n19.05\n11.53\n3.67\n9.93\n17.14\n26.81\n49.41\n\n\n2023\n28\n20.60\n11.38\n4.65\n11.71\n21.18\n27.02\n52.57"

    "text": "Refugees Landscape across the EU Countries\nWe next examine the trends in refugee inflows across EU countries during the periods of interest, 2014–2016–2023. Focusing on these intervals allows us to capture the dynamics of refugee influxes during episodes of heightened displacement and policy response, and to assess cross-country heterogeneity in the scale and timing of inflows within the European Union.\nIn Figure 2 we observe that countries such as Sweden, Malta, Norway, and Austria admitted the highest number of refugees per 1,000 residents during the 2014–2016 period.\nIn contrast, more recent data from 2023 indicate a shift in the distribution of refugee inflows, with Cyprus, Germany, Czechia, and Estonia emerging as the leading recipient countries. In addition, there is some evidence of convergence across countries, as refugee inflows appear to cluster within a range of approximately 25–35 refugees per 1,000 residents, suggesting a narrowing of cross-country variation in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Refugee Numbers by Country 2014-16-23\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3, the faceted plot, we observe that while some countries exhibit gradual increases in refugees per 1,000 residents over time, others experience sharp rises concentrated in the last three to four years. This highlights substantial heterogeneity in the timing and intensity of refugee inflows across countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo assess the relationship between refugee inflows and countries’ geographic proximity, Figure 4 illustrates the spatial distribution of refugee inflows across European countries from 2010 to 2023. This spatial analysis helps identify potential geographic patterns, clustering, and regional trends in refugee movements, thereby providing deeper insight into the spatial dimensions of refugee inflows across Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, while geographic proximity might be expected to be associated with higher refugee inflows, the spatial distribution shown in the map suggests otherwise. Neighboring countries do not necessarily exhibit similar levels of refugee intake, and countries that are geographically distant may experience comparable refugee inflows. This pattern challenges the assumption that refugee arrivals are primarily driven by geographic closeness and points to the importance of institutional, policy, and economic factors in shaping refugee settlement patterns."

The figure highlights substantial cross-country heterogeneity in both levels and trends, indicating that housing markets responded differently over time across the European sample. While some countries experienced steady expansions in housing supply, others exhibited more volatile or stagnant patterns, underscoring the importance of accounting for country-specific housing market conditions in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter examining housing supply, we turn to the distribution of housing prices using the Housing Price Index. Figure 6 presents a ridge plot of HPI values for countries with high refugee inflows between 2014 and 2023. Each ridge represents the distribution of HPI values in a given year, with the height of the curve reflecting the density of countries around particular price levels. The rightward shift of the distributions over time indicates a general increase in housing prices across the decade, suggesting an overall upward trend in housing markets that is not, by itself, directly attributable to refugee inflows."

The contemporaneous refugee growth coefficient is positive and statistically significant, while the one-year lag is negative and statistically significant. The opposite signs and small magnitudes of these coefficients suggest short-run offsetting dynamics rather than a persistent effect on housing prices.\nImportantly, the increase in model fit is relatively limited, and the dominant share of explanatory power continues to stem from the fixed effects. This indicates that housing price growth is primarily driven by structural country-level factors and macroeconomic time shocks, rather than by sustained changes in refugee inflows."

In the 1960s, the fertility rate was nearly eight children per woman, largely driven by the country’s conservative and religious social structure. In contrast, recent decades have seen a dramatic decline, with fertility rates falling to around two children per woman. This sharp reduction can be attributed to sweeping socio-economic reforms, including the expansion of women’s education, shifts in female labor market participation, and broader societal transformations under Vision 2030.\nThis project aims to analyze and forecast Saudi Arabia’s fertility rate using the ARIMA model.

    "text": "ARIMA modeling\nHaving established that the series is integrated of order one (I=1) , the next step is to identify the appropriate ARIMA specification by selecting the autoregressive (p), and moving average (q) orders.\nMultiple ARIMA models were estimated and evaluated through an iterative process, including ARIMA(1,1,0), ARIMA(2,1,0), ARIMA(1,1,1), and ARIMA(4,1,0). Model performance was assessed using information criteria (AICc and BIC) as well as residual diagnostics based on the Ljung–Box test.The Ljung–Box test was conducted at lags 8 and 16. The choice of 16 lags follows the standard rule-of-thumb of N/4, where N = 64 in this case. Table 3 summarizes the estimated coefficients, information criteria, and Ljung–Box test statistics for each candidate model.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Comparison of ARIMA Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAR(1)\nARMA(1,1)\nAR(2)\nAR(4)\n\n\n\n\nTheta1.SE.\n0.15 (0.142)\n0.079 (0.455)\n0.153 (0.142)\n-0.148 (0.131)\n\n\nTheta2.SE.\nN/A\nN/A\n-0.059 (0.144)\n-0.174 (0.122)\n\n\nTheta3.SE.\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n-0.462 (0.121)\n\n\nTheta4.SE.\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n-0.513 (0.128)\n\n\nPhi1.SE.\nN/A\n0.074 (0.431)\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nAICc\n-303.789\n-301.609\n-301.748\n-318.458\n\n\nBIC\n-299.738\n-295.642\n-295.780\n-308.894\n\n\nLB8.p.value.\n17.1 ( 0.01679 )\n17.24 ( 0.0159 )\n17.92 ( 0.00643 )\n7.97 ( 0.09276 )\n\n\nLB16.p.value.\n28.76 (0.01729)\n28.9 (0.01655)\n29.67 (0.00847)\n17.14 (0.14428)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results indicate the following:\nARIMA(1,1,0): This model performs well in terms of AICc and BIC. However, the Ljung–Box test rejects the null hypothesis of no residual autocorrelation at both lag lengths, indicating that the residuals do not behave as white noise. As a result, the model is deemed inadequate.\nARIMA(1,1,1): Despite competitive information criteria values, this model also fails the Ljung–Box test, rejecting the null hypothesis of white-noise residuals. This suggests remaining serial correlation and model misspecification.\nARIMA(2,1,0): Although this specification improves flexibility relative to the AR(1) model and maintains reasonable AICc and BIC values, it similarly fails the Ljung–Box diagnostic tests, indicating persistent autocorrelation in the residuals.\nARIMA(4,1,0): This model delivers superior overall performance. It achieves competitive information criteria values while, crucially, failing to reject the null hypothesis of the Ljung–Box test at both lag lengths. This implies that the residuals behave as white noise, satisfying the key assumption of model adequacy."

To obtain efficient and unbiased inference—particularly for volatility dynamics—a GARCH-type specification is required.\nThat said, the ARIMA model remains informative for short-run forecasting of the conditional mean, especially when volatility dynamics are not the primary object of interest. Subsequent analysis will therefore extend the model by incorporating a GARCH structure to appropriately model the variance process."

    "text": "Estimate AR(4)–GARCH(1,1)\nBuilding on the previous results, the ARIMA(4,1,0) specification is retained to model the conditional mean dynamics of the series, as it adequately removes serial correlation in the residuals. However, diagnostic evidence indicates the presence of time-varying volatility, motivating an extension of the model to explicitly account for conditional heteroskedasticity.\nAccordingly, the model is specified as an AR(4) process in the mean combined with a GARCH(1,1) process for the conditional variance. The estimated variance parameters from the GARCH(1,1) specification are reported in Table 5, and the full model is summarized by the mean and variance equations presented below. This framework allows the dynamics of the series to be decomposed into systematic persistence in the mean and persistent volatility in the variance, providing a more complete representation of both the level and uncertainty of the process.\n\n\n\nTable 5: GARCH(1,1) Variance Parameters\n\n\nParameter\nEstimate\n\n\n\n\nomega\n0.0000\n\n\nalpha1\n0.4338\n\n\nbeta1\n0.5652\n\n\nalpha1 + beta1\n0.9990\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimated GARCH(1,1) variance parameters indicate strong and highly persistent volatility dynamics in the series. The ARCH coefficient, (_1 =) 0.4338, captures the short-run response of conditional variance to unexpected shocks and suggests that large innovations have a substantial immediate impact on volatility. The GARCH coefficient, (_1 =) 0.5652, reflects persistence in volatility, indicating that periods of elevated uncertainty tend to persist over time.\nThe sum of the ARCH and GARCH coefficients, (_1 + _1 =) 0.999, is extremely close to unity, implying near-integrated volatility dynamics. While the condition (_1 + _1 &lt; 1) technically ensures covariance stationarity of the variance process, the proximity to one suggests that shocks to volatility decay very slowly and have long-lasting effects. This behavior is consistent with pronounced volatility clustering.\nThe estimated constant term in the variance equation, (=) 3^{-6}, is effectively zero, indicating that the evolution of volatility is largely driven by past shocks and past conditional variance rather than by a fixed long-run variance level.\nOverall, these results confirm that extending the AR(4) mean specification with a GARCH(1,1) variance process is necessary to appropriately model time-varying volatility and to obtain reliable inference and forecast uncertainty.\nThe AR(4)–GARCH(1,1) model is formally specified below through its conditional mean and variance equations.\nThe mean equation remains the selected AR(4) specification:\n[ y_t = ,y_{t-1} + ,y_{t-2} + ,y_{t-3} + ,y_{t-4} + _t ]\nThe conditional variance follows a GARCH(1,1) process:\n[ t^2 = 0.4338,{t-1}^2 + 0.5652,_{t-1}^2 ]"
