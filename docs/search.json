    "text": "Homelessness is one of New York City’s most persistent and structurally complex policy challenges. It has remained a central issue for successive governors, mayors, and political leaders, reflecting deep-rooted pressures in the city’s housing market and social safety net. Public discourse and empirical research have consistently linked homelessness to housing affordability, particularly rising rents, with higher rental costs often associated with increases in the number of individuals relying on shelter systems. Understanding the dynamic relationship between rental prices and shelter population is therefore critical for policymakers seeking to design effective housing and homelessness interventions.\nThis report conducts a detailed time-series analysis using a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) framework to examine the relationship between the monthly average shelter population and the median asking rent in New York City over the period from March 2021 to October 2025. The analysis explores how these two variables co-evolve over time and interact through their respective lag structures. In addition, the estimated model is used to generate forecasts for both variables over a 12-month horizon, from November 2025 to October 2026, providing insight into potential future trends in housing affordability and shelter demand."

Time series that exhibit trends or unit roots can lead to spurious regression results if modeled in levels.\nVisual inspection of the level series Figure 1 in the Appendix indicates that both the monthly average shelter population and the median asking rent display trending behavior. Consistent with this observation, Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test results reported in Table 1 fail to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root for both series.\nApplying logarithmic transformations does not resolve the non-stationarity. As shown in Figure 2 and confirmed by the ADF results in Table 2, the log-transformed series remain non-stationary.\nHowever, taking first differences of the logarithmic series yields stationary processes. Figure 3 demonstrates stable behavior for both differenced series, and the ADF test results in Table 3 reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity at conventional significance levels. Consequently, both variables are treated as integrated of order one, I(1), and the VAR model is estimated using first differences of the log-transformed series."

As reported in Table 4, the test statistic for the null hypothesis of no cointegration (r = 0) is 8.26, which is below the 5 percent critical value of 15.67. Therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, indicating no evidence of a stable long-run relationship between shelter population and median rent.\nGiven the absence of cointegration, a VAR model in first differences is appropriate, and a VECM specification is not warranted."

    "text": "In recent decades, global conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises have led to a significant rise in refugee movements across the world. Prolonged wars in Syria, Afghanistan, and Ukraine; ethnic and religious persecution in countries like Myanmar and Eritrea; and widespread violence & the unlawful occupation in regions such as Palestine have forced millions of individuals to seek safety beyond their national borders. The European Union (EU) presents an interesting case with regards to being an area of protection for individuals who are seeking protection and refuge. EU states recognize asylum as a fundamental human right under the 1951 Geneva Convention (European Commission, Migration & Home Affairs 2021). In order to share responsibility to welcome asylum seekers in a dignified manner, EU member states have established the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) in 1999. However the year 2015 saw a record number of refugees and asylum seekers emigrating to the EU seeking asylum and refuge, which made the EU to consider revamping its migration policies as a whole.\nThe arrival of refugees in European countries has generated a debate on its economic and social impacts. One key concern is the effect of refugee inflows on housing markets, particularly house prices. While some argue that increased demand from refugees raises house prices, others go on to suggest that concentration in low-income areas may depress local markets. This research aims to examine the relationship between refugee intake and house price dynamics in different European countries. In this context, countries which have restrictive refugee policies can act as a control group while countries which have more open integration policies for refugees will be a treatment group. The policy shock that will be exploring will be increased acceptance of refugees post the year 2015-16 by the European countries.\nIn view of the above, and in order to explore the relationship between the variable under scrutiny, our research questions will be as follows:\n- How does the variation in refugee intake amongst European countries impact house prices?"

This makes for a good case of comparison in research analysis which will be discussed in detail further in an ensuing section. While access to the labor market may be restricted by administrative (e.g. work permits, authorizations or visas) and practical barriers (e.g. language, social skills, etc.), refugees have the legal right to work in all OECD countries. For asylum seekers, the rights and obligations differ significantly from one country to another. Most countries, however, grant access to the labour market to some groups of applicants on certain conditions, including a prior waiting period, ranging between 2 months in Italy to 12 months in the United Kingdom."

Also, there is some evidence of convergence among number of refugees accepted by countries in the range of 25-35 refugees per 1000 residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking the faceted plot, we see while some countries have seen gradual increasing trends in refugees per 1000 residents, others have seen sharp rise in the last 3-4 years.\nNext, we classified countries into three groups based on their average number of refugees per 1,000 residents over the years 2010–2023. The thresholds were derived from the summary statistics (specifically, the median and 3rd quartile “because the data is right skewed”) of the variable “refugees per 1,000 residents”:\n\n\n\nAverage Refugees per 1000 Residents (2010–2023) and Influx Classification\n\n\nCountry\navg_refugees_per_1000\nrefugee_influx_group\n\n\n\n\nSweden\n22.90\nHigh\n\n\nMalta\n21.46\nHigh\n\n\nCyprus\n18.61\nHigh\n\n\nAustria\n17.38\nHigh\n\n\nGermany\n14.91\nHigh\n\n\nNorway\n11.82\nHigh\n\n\nLuxembourg\n9.67\nHigh\n\n\nNetherlands\n7.26\nMedium\n\n\nBelgium\n7.00\nMedium\n\n\nFrance\n6.39\nMedium\n\n\nDenmark\n6.08\nMedium\n\n\nCzechia\n5.71\nMedium\n\n\nFinland\n5.58\nMedium\n\n\nIreland\n5.51\nMedium\n\n\nBulgaria\n5.47\nLow\n\n\nIceland\n5.00\nLow\n\n\nEstonia\n4.55\nLow\n\n\nLithuania\n4.16\nLow\n\n\nPoland\n4.15\nLow\n\n\nItaly\n3.55\nLow\n\n\nLatvia\n3.48\nLow\n\n\nSlovakia\n3.09\nLow\n\n\nSpain\n2.86\nLow\n\n\nHungary\n1.59\nLow\n\n\nCroatia\n1.12\nLow\n\n\nPortugal\n1.01\nLow\n\n\nSlovenia\n0.98\nLow\n\n\nRomania\n0.89\nLow\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Refugee Influx: Average above 7.8631702 (above the 3rd quartile, Q3)\nMedium Refugee Influx: Average between 5.4905071 and 7.8631702 (between the 1st and 3rd quartiles, Q1 and Q3)\nLow Refugee Influx: Average below 5.4905071 (below the 1st quartile, Q1)\nThis classification method ensures a balanced and data-informed grouping of countries, highlighting those with unusually high or low refugee influxes relative to the sample distribution.\nLet’s now turn our focus to the Housing Prices and the Housing Price Index (HPI). THe HPI is used as proxy for the housing prices for the purpose of this report. The following data visualization presents how different countries had their housing supply change over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter looking at the housing supply in different EU countries, in this section, we will have a look at what the Housing Price Index (HPI) with the help of a Ridge Plot. This visualizes how the EU HPI is distributed across the years 2014 to 2023 for countries with high refugee inflows. Each ridge represents the distribution of HPI values in a given year, with the height of the curve indicating the density (concentration) of countries around particular HPI values. The color gradient—ranging from dark purple to orange—corresponds to the HPI scale, enhancing visual separation of low and high housing price levels. Most interestingly, this plot helps reveal shifts in housing price trends over time: for example, the ridges shifting rightward (toward higher HPI values), indicates a general increase in housing prices over the decade without the impact or effect of refugee intake by EU countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will examine the average House Price Index (HPI) over the years 2010 to 2021 to identify trends across the three refugee influx groups: High, Medium, and Low. This will help visualize how housing markets evolved over time within each group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountries with medium and low refugee influx saw faster growth in housing prices after 2016, while those with high refugee influx experienced more moderate growth. This may imply that a higher influx of refugees could be associated with housing market stabilization effects or greater public housing intervention, but further analysis would be needed to isolate causal mechanisms. Additionally, we can observe that the trend before the 2015 shock wasn’t consistent across these groups.\nWhile remaining on the data visualization front of HPI, we can also decipher the country wise trends in those nations which accepted the highest number of refugees from the year 2014 to 2023 in the form of a Faceted line plot, which is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we will examine the refugees influx spatially across European countries from 2010 to 2023. This spatial analysis will help identify potential spatial patterns, clusters, and trends in refugee movement, facilitating deeper insights into refugee patterns across Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, while one might expect that countries in closer geographical proximity would experience similar refugee influxes, the map suggests otherwise. It challenges the assumption that neighboring countries would necessarily share similar refugee patterns, as countries farther apart may exhibit comparable levels of refugee arrivals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we try to do some exploratory analysis to understand the relationship between growth of HPI and change in refugees per 1000 residents. Scatterplot indicates weak correlation between the two variables."

Specifically, current refugee inflows lead to higher housing price growth, as seen in both the Full Model and the Full Model + Housing, where a positive relationship is established. This likely reflects the demand for housing that arises when refugee populations increase, either through direct housing needs or indirectly due to the economic integration of refugees in the host country. On the other hand, lagged refugee inflows show a negative effect on housing growth, suggesting that initial boosts in housing demand may be followed by a lagged response, possibly due to market adjustments, overbuilding in earlier periods, or delayed policy interventions.\nThe inclusion of housing supply growth control suggests positive effect of refugees dominate, however, the positive coefficient on housing supply is contrary to expectations.\nThis suggests possible endogeneity concerns in the data that we have been working with. Therefore, we have come forth with the Shift Share approach which can be viewed in the next section."

The coefficient on Bartik_Z is 12.23 (SE = 0.49), highly significant at the 1% level, indicating a strong positive relationship. The model explains 73% of the variation in refugee inflows (R² = 0.73), and the weak instruments test statistic of 627.45 far exceeds the conventional threshold, ruling out weak instrument concerns. These results validate the strength and relevance of the instrument that we will be employing in the ensuing the second-stage analysis.\nHere, our group also wants to highlight before presenting the Bartik approach results that, we constructed the instrument by interacting global, origin-specific refugee supply shocks with each country’s historical settlement shares, averaged over the 2010–2014 pre-crisis period. This design assumes that historical refugee settlement patterns are exogenous to future housing market shocks and that global refugee flows are driven primarily by geopolitical events outside the control of host countries. We deliberately limit our baseline specification to exclude additional controls such as GDP or inflation to avoid overfitting, multicollinearity, and possible post-treatment bias, focusing instead on the exogenous variation introduced by the instrument.\nThis table presents the second-stage results of a two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression estimating the causal impact of refugee inflows on housing prices (HPI), using a Bartik-style instrument to address endogeneity concerns. The coefficient on Total_Refugees is effectively zero and statistically insignificant, suggesting that instrumented refugee inflows do not have a detectable impact on country level HPI throughout the countries and years studied. The constant term is highly significant, reflecting the baseline level of HPI when refugee inflows are zero. With an R² of 0.008, the model explains less than 1% of the variation in HPI, reinforcing the conclusion that, at the aggregate level, refugee arrivals—when instrumented by exogenous global shocks—do not significantly influence housing market prices (which our group has proxied by way of HPI)."

    "text": "Over the past six decades, Saudi Arabia has undergone one of the most rapid fertility transitions in the world. In the 1960s, the fertility rate was nearly eight children per woman, largely driven by the country’s conservative and religious social structure. In contrast, recent decades have seen a dramatic decline, with fertility rates falling to around two children per woman. This sharp reduction can be attributed to sweeping socio-economic reforms, including the expansion of women’s education, shifts in female labor market participation, and broader societal transformations under Vision 2030.\nThis project aims to analyze and forecast Saudi Arabia’s fertility rate using the ARIMA model. By modeling historical trends and projecting future changes, the study seeks to shed light on the potential implications of fertility dynamics for labor market policies and broader social development strategies in Saudi Arabia."
